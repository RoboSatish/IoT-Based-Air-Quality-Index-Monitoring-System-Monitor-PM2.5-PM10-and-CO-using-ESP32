# IoT-Based-Air-Quality-Index-Monitoring-System-Monitor-PM2.5-PM10-and-CO-using-ESP32

To build an ESP32 Air Quality Monitoring System using Nova PM SDS011 sensor, MQ-7 sensor, and DHT11 sensor. We will also be using an OLED Display module to display Air Quality Values. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in India is based on eight pollutants, PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NO2, CO, Ozone, NH3, and Pb. However, it is not necessary to measure all of the pollutants. So we are going to measure the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, and Carbon Monoxide to calculate the Air Quality Index
